# weather_api

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

We have to Work on Basic Scenario:-
1. Display the current temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather
   condition.
2. Show the 3-day weather forecast with the date, temperature range, and weather conditions.
3. Implement a refresh functionality to update the weather data.
4. Handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages if API calls fail.
5. Ensure the app is responsive and looks visually appealing across different screen sizes.
6. Use best practices for code organization and maintainability.
7. Pay attention to performance optimization and efficient data fetching.
